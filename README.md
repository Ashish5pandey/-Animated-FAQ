# -Animated-FAQ
*This project is an interactive Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that allows users to click on a question to reveal or collapse the corresponding answer, with smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.*

Key Features:
Collapsible Answers: The FAQ is structured with HTML, displaying a list of questions. Answers are initially hidden and can be revealed when the user clicks on a question.
Smooth Animations: CSS is used to style the FAQ section and provide a smooth expanding and collapsing effect when toggling answers, offering a visually appealing experience.
JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript handles the click events, toggling the visibility of the answers when a question is clicked. The script also ensures that only one answer is open at a time (optional) and applies animations for the transition.
Responsive Design: The section is styled to work seamlessly on all devices, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile screens.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the FAQ section, with each question and hidden answer element.
CSS: For styling the FAQ and implementing smooth transitions and animations during the expand/collapse effect.
JavaScript: For handling user interactions, such as clicking on questions to toggle the visibility of answers.
